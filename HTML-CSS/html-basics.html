                  If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging â€” we will hold your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel 
                    comfortable and learn the topics properly. You should feel at home whether you are a student learning web development 
                    (on your own or as part of a class), a teacher looking for class materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how 
                   web technologies work. Blah blah </p>
