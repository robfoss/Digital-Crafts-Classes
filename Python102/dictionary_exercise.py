# Create a program that starts with an empty dictionary.
# Add 3 different key value pairs to the empty dictionary.
# Create a program with a dictionary called person.
# The person dictionary needs to have the keys, first_name, last_name, age, hair_color.
# Print each one of these key/values pairs without directly using the key's name as a string by using a for loop.
# After each key value pair, print out a sentence using each one of the keys.
#     Hello Clint Fleetwood. Since you are 38 years old you are too old to ride this ride, but you do have nice brown hair.
# Create a program that has a list of dictionaries of people, with each dictionary including name, phone, email.
# For each dictionary print the items in the dictionary.
